The benchmark is executed using scripts in scripts directory. The main
executable is benchmark.sh, which is given several arguments:
benchmark.sh
  name_of_the_benchmark      -- date is added to it
  containers_repo            -- repo with containers, write 'none' for
                             --   system containers library
  cabal_configure_opts       -- optional flags passed to cabal configure

The benchmark.sh just calls other scripts:
  compile.sh containers_repo cabal_configure_opts   -- builds the benchmark
  run.sh name_of_the_benchmark                      -- run built benchmark
  collect.pl name_of_benchmark      -- collect all results in one .csv file

Other scripts:
  see.sh < name_of_csv              -- formats the csv file for viewing
  cmp.pl base_csv diff_csv          -- generate csv with comparison of two tests
  cmp.sh base_csv diff_csv          -- formats the result of cmp.pl for viewing

  ghc.sh containers_repo ghc_repo result_csv
    -- Compiles the GHC repo with given containers and store results
    -- the size of GHC and the memory allocation results of performance tests
    -- are stored. These tests were once a regression, so we monitor them.
    -- The GHC repo must be already booted and configured.
